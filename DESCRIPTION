Description: 
  In streaming data analysis, it is crucial to detect significant shifts in the data distribution or the accuracy of predictive models over time, a phenomenon known as **concept drift**. The **heimdall** package aims to identify when concept drift occurs and provide methodologies for adapting models in non-stationary environments. 
  It offers a range of state-of-the-art techniques for detecting concept drift and maintaining model performance. Additionally, **heimdall** provides tools for adapting models in response to these changes, ensuring continuous and accurate predictions in dynamic contexts.
  Methods for concept drift detection are described in Tavares (2022) <doi:10.1007/s12530-021-09415-z>.
