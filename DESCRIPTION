Description: By analyzing streaming datasets, it is possible to observe significant changes in the data distribution or models' accuracy during their prediction. Heimdall's goal is to measure when these events occur. Heimdall also tackles how to adapt models in a nonstationary context. Harbinger contains several state-of-the-art methods. Data distribution changes are described in Tavares (2022) <doi:10.1007/s12530-021-09415-z>.
