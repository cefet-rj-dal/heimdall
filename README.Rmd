Heimdall is a tool designed for concept drift detection in continuous data streams. When analyzing time series data, it is possible to observe significant changes in the data distribution or in the accuracy of predictive models during the forecasting process. These changes are known as concept drift.

The goal of the Heimdall package is to detect when concept drift occurs, enabling the detection and adaptation of models in non-stationary contexts. The package offers several state-of-the-art methods to identify and handle concept drift, as well as techniques for efficient model adaptation.
