## Heimdall

By analyzing streaming datasets, it is possible to observe significant
changes in the data distribution or modelsâ€™ accuracy during their
prediction (concept drift). The goal of Heimdall is to measure when
concept drift occurs. The package makes available several
state-of-the-art methods. It also tackles how to adapt models in a
nonstationary context.
